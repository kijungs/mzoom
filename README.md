M-Zoom / M-Biz
========================
**M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom)** and **M-Biz (Multidimensional Bi-directional Zoom)** are algorithms for detecting dense subtensors. 
They have the following properties: 
 * *scalable*: scales almost linearly with all input factors
 * *provably accurate*: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
 * *flexible*: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-subtensor detection, and size bounds
